`dry-configurable` is a simple mixin to add thread-safe configuration behaviour to your classes. There are many libraries that make use of configuration, and each seemed to have their own implementation with a similar or duplicate interface, so we thought it was strange that this behaviour had not already been encapsulated into a reusable gem, hence `dry-configurable` was born.
